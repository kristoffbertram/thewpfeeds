# Freshet Feeds

Developer-first external feeds for WordPress. LinkedIn company-page posts first; every provider feeds the same normalized item model and the same theme-overridable templates, so styling a feed is exactly like styling any other WordPress loop.

## Why

Feed plugins render fixed markup you style through *their* settings UI. This plugin inverts that: **your theme owns the markup**.

```php
// Anywhere in your theme:
foreach ( freshet_feeds( 'linkedin-main' ) as $item ) {
    printf(
        '<article><h3>%s</h3><time>%s</time><p>%s</p></article>',
        esc_html( $item->title( 'Untitled' ) ),
        esc_html( $item->date() ),
        esc_html( $item->excerpt( 30 ) )
    );
}

// Or render through the template chain:
freshet_feeds_render( 'linkedin-main', [ 'layout' => 'grid' ] );
```

## Templating

WooCommerce-style overrides. Copy any file from `templates/` into `{your-theme}/freshet-feeds/` and edit:

| Template | Overrides |
|---|---|
| `item.php` | One card — the file you'll override 90% of the time |
| `layout-grid.php`, `layout-list.php` | The loop structure |
| `feed.php` | Outer wrapper |
| `empty.php` | No-items state (error details shown to admins only) |

Custom layouts: add `{your-theme}/freshet-feeds/layout-carousel.php` and pass `layout => 'carousel'` — no plugin changes needed.

Every item exposes: `title($fallback)`, `date($format)`, `datetime()`, `content()`, `excerpt($words)`, `url()`, `hasImage()`, `image()`, `imageTag($attrs)`, `author()`, and `raw()` (the untouched provider payload). Getters return raw values — escape in your templates.

## Feeds & providers

Manage feeds under **Feeds** in wp-admin. v1 providers:

- **LinkedIn (company page)** — bring-your-own LinkedIn developer app with Community Management API access; OAuth connect under Feeds → LinkedIn connections. Posts are fetched via cron (stale-while-revalidate — pages never block on LinkedIn) and images are copied locally because LinkedIn image URLs expire.
- **Mock (fixture data)** — realistic LinkedIn-shaped data with zero credentials; available outside production for building templates. 

Third-party providers plug in via the `freshet_feeds_register_providers` action.

Free version: 1 feed. Pro: unlimited.

## Development

```bash
composer install          # PHP deps + autoloader (required to activate)
composer test             # unit tests (Brain Monkey, no WP install needed)
composer lint             # phpcs

npm install
npm run build             # build the Gutenberg block into build/
npm run start             # block dev watch
```

Local WordPress via Herd: symlink this directory into a site's `wp-content/plugins/` and activate. For the LinkedIn OAuth flow the site must be HTTPS (`herd secure`) and the redirect URI shown on the Feeds screen must be registered in your LinkedIn app.

Pipeline smoke test:

```bash
wp freshet-feeds fetch <feed-slug> --force
wp freshet-feeds status
```
